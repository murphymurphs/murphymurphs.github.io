Literature review was selected as the primary method as the aim of the paper is to provide a broad overview of existing knowledge.
 Components of the universe
This chapter will give a general overview of what objects and particles exist and
everything in the universe is made off. It will also discuss the fundamental forces and how they interact with the components.
The chapter is split into two parts, â€˜a)â€™ examines the fundamental components on a microscopic and submicroscopic scale, while â€˜b)â€™ describes larger structures made up of the particles from â€˜a)â€™, which in cosmology are not considered to be structures, but rather objects making up structures.
Fundamental components
1.1 Matter
1.1.1 Ordinary matter
Ordinary matter, also known as baryonic matter, makes up the type of matter which we are most familiar with. This includes protonsâº, neutrons and electronsâ», forming the atoms which make up everything we can observe directly. Examples of this are stars, planets and living organisms. According to our current models however, baryonic matter only constitutes about 5% of the total mass-energy of the universe1. The remaining approximately 95% is made up of dark matter and dark energy, which will be discussed in later sections.
Atoms are composed of a nucleus at the center (protonsâº and generally also neutrons) and electronsâ» orbiting it. These atoms combine to form molecules which in turn make up the matter we can observe on the macroscopic scale.
The composition of ordinary matter is heavily dominated by hydrogen and helium, together making up 98% of the baryonic mass in the universe2.
Ordinary matter is also where chemistry takes place.
1.1.2 Elementary particles of matter (fermions)
Fermions are the most basic form of matter particles in the universe as they are not composed of smaller particles. They can be divided into two categories: quarks and leptons. Quarks make up protonsâº and neutrons, while leptons include electronsâ».
All fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is crucial for the structure of matter, as it ensures that electronsâ» in atoms occupy distinct energy levels, preventing matter from collapsing4.
Quarks
There are six types (â€œflavorsâ€) of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. Quarks are never found in isolation due to a phenomenon called color confinement; instead, they combine to form hadrons, such as protonsâº (two up quarks and one down quark) and neutrons (two down quarks and one up quark)3. Hadrons made up of three quarks are called baryons, thus the name baryonic matter.
Leptons
There are also six types of leptons: electronâ», muon, tau and for each of those their neutrino. While the electronâ» is widely known and plays a key role in baryonic matter and other phenomena, muon and tau are heavier and less stable. Neutrinos are extremely light and very weakly interact with matter3.
Antiparticles
Every fermion also has a so-called â€˜evil-twinâ€™, an antiparticle. For example there is an anti-down quark, an anti-up quark or for the electronâ» a positronâº. These anti-particles are theoretically capable of forming anti-protonsâ», anti-neutrons and consequently anti-atoms, and even anti molecules just like regular matter.
Antiparticles are like their â€˜normalâ€™ counterparts, just with opposite charge, time and parity (known as CPT-reversal). They occur in some natural processes and are essential in applications related to beta decay. Collision with their counterparts leads to mutual annihilation and creation of photons, neutrinos and other particle-antiparticle pairs.
Since our observable universe is mostly filled with ordinary (not anti) matter, they are hard to keep for longer periods of time and in masses since they will collide and will be removed from existence. This asymmetry between ordinary and antimatter is one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics and has yet to be solved7.
1.1.3 Dark matter
Dark matter is a form of matter which does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, thus making it invisible to current light-based telescopes. It makes up around 25% of the total mass-energy of the universe, putting it in second place1. Its presence is only observed indirectly through gravitational effects on visible matter.
One of the primary pieces of evidence for dark matter is the rotation curve of galaxies, for example the milky way. Stars on the outer edge of these galaxies rotated much faster than what is expected when accounting for the amount of visible matter alone, consequently prompting scientists to believe there may be some form of matter which only interacts with gravitation and, unlike baryonic matter, not with the electromagnetic force5.
Another phenomena which can be explained by the presence of dark matter is stronger gravitational lensing â€“ where the gravity of a massive object bends light from distant sources â€“ than it should from what is expected by the amount of baryonic matter6.
While an alternation of the gravitational law (globally, locally or on larger scales) is theorized, there are observed effects that cannot be explained by such modifications6.
â€œAn 8 Ïƒ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.â€

While the exact composition of dark matter remains unknown, leading candidates include weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions, theoretical particles that could account for its behavior.

1.2 Fundamental forces and their carriers (bosons)
In addition to fermions, which are responsible for forming matter, bosons are elementary particles that act as force carriers. They mediate interactions between particles, thus enabling the fundamental forces which shape our universe. Each fundamental force has bosons/a boson associated with it with the exception of gravity.
1.2.1 Electromagnetic force (EMF)
The photon is responsible for mediating the electromagnetic force and is responsible for interactions between charged particles. Phenomena it is responsible for include: the structure of atoms, the behavior of electromagnetic waves (including light), magnetism and electricity. Its range is infinite but weakens over distance. Photons have no mass nor charge, making them, in a vacuum, travel at the universeâ€™s maximum speed, the speed of light at approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.
1.2.2 Strong nuclear force
The gluon mediates the strong nuclear force. The force responsible for holding together quarks inside hadrons like protonsâº and neutrons, as well as holding together protonsâº and neutrons inside an atom's nucleus, thus making it essential for the stability of matter. It is about 100 times stronger than the EMF and 1038 times stronger than the gravitational force, making it, as the name suggests, by far the strongest of the fundamental forces8. However it only operates at subatomic scales, at about the range of an atomic nucleus8.
1.2.3 Weak nuclear force
The WÂ± and Z Boson mediates the weak nuclear force, which can change one quark type into another. This makes nuclear fusion possible and is what brings our sun to shine, by changing a quark inside a neutron making it a protonâº, thus changing the element. It also plays a part in radioactive decay. It only acts on even smaller distances than the strong nuclear force, about a 1000 times smaller ones and also is about a million times weaker than it8.
1.2.4 Gravity
The gravitational force is unique among the fundamental forces, being the only one where the particle mediating its interaction is currently unknown. The graviton is theorized to be its carrier but it has not been observed nor proven yet. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces but operates over infinite distances and dominates at large scales.
It is responsible for the motion of stars and planets, has an influence on the expansion of the universe (which occurs because of dark energy), and forms galaxies and the cosmic web9.
1.2.5 Higgs Field
The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012 at CERN10, is associated with the higgs field which â€“ unlike other bosons, does not mediate a force â€“ imparts mass to elementary particles.

1.3 Dark energy
Dark energy is something which makes up around 70% of our universeâ€™s total energy1. It drives and accelerates the expansion of the universe. Its exact nature is not yet known and it is described as the H0 Hubble Constant13. 

Larger Components
1.4 Planetary Bodies
Planetary bodies are a range of objects, typically orbiting a star, which do not produce their own light.
1.4.1 Planets
Planets are more or less spherical objects which have mostly cleared their orbit of other debris. They can be classified by multiple factors such as their mass, their orbit and by their composition. Tons of exoplanets, meaning planets outside our solar system, have been discovered and cataloged so far, and are at the center of the search for extraterrestrial life.
1.4.2 Moons
Moons are classified as having an orbit around a planet or other larger objects which are not stars and being significantly smaller than the object they orbit.

1.5 Stellar bodies and phenomena
1.5.1 Stars
A star is a glowing near-spherical object held together by its own gravity produced by its mass. They are formed by galactic molecular clouds collapsing due to their mass. Stars go through predictable life cycles depending on their mass and can be classified as such. The unit for this is usually Mâ˜‰, where 1Mâ˜‰ equals the mass of our sun. Stars burn fuel, usually hydrogen and/or helium, till it is all almost used up before coming to their final stage of life. The process of burning is nuclear fusion, happening mainly in the starâ€™s core due to the high pressure there, which releases big amounts of energy26.
Very-low-mass stars
These are classified having a mass less than half of our sunâ€™s mass, or below 0.5 Mâ˜‰. After using up almost all of their fuel they become helium white dwarfs. These are very dense objects having about earthâ€™s size while still having much of their original mass and slowly cool down. Their life cycle is longer than the universeâ€™s age so no such star has reached its final form of white dwarf yet27.
Low-mass stars
These stars, including our sun, are classified between 0.5Mâ˜‰ and about 2.25Mâ˜‰. When they have used up their hydrogen, they start to burn helium at their core. These are then called red giants, which, after a while, blow their outer shell outwards, which becomes a planetary nebula, leaving their core as a white dwarf at the center28.
Intermediate-mass stars
Between 2.25Mâ˜‰ and 8Mâ˜‰, intermediate-mass stars have similar life cycle as low-mass stars, but spend a shorter time in their red giant state28.
Massive stars
Massive stars are stars with over 8Mâ˜‰ and they generally become supergiants, which, due to their high mass and pressure at the core, create heavier elements. They usually die in supernovae, which are massive explosions, leaving very dense objects such as neutron stars or black holes28.
These life cycles may differ in binary (or more) star systems.
1.5.2 Supernovae
Typ I supernovae
These types of supernovae are produced by thermal runaway reactions by white dwarfs in binary star systems. An accretion disk around the smaller, more massive star forms from sucking out the material of the second, lighter star. This leads to the gravitational pull becoming so strong the star implodes and resulting in a supernovae30.
Typ II supernovae
These supernovae are produced by the collapse of massive stars. This spreads heavy elements previously produced by them into the universe29.
1.5.3 Neutron stars
Neutron starâ€™s are remnants of supernovae of massive stars. Second only to black holes, they are the densest known objects in the universe with masses of about 1.4Mâ˜‰ and radius of only about 10 kilometers, while the core is only the size of an atomic nucleus. The stars producing these objects have masses of around 20Mâ˜‰ to 25Mâ˜‰31. Neutron stars often spin at immense speeds producing strong magnetic fields, which can shoot out charged particles at the poles; if they do, they are called pulsars.
1.5.4 Black holes
Like neutron stars, black holes are remnants of supernovae, although they could be theoretically created by other processes as well32. At the center they possess a singularity, meaning a region or rather point of spacetime where the curvature of space time itself becomes infinite. Another prominent feature is the event horizon, it is the boundary between where light, and anything else is not able to escape anymore. While this event horizon can not be observed directly, accretion disks can form around black holes which in turn make it visible. This has led to the first ever direct picture of a black hole by the Event horizon telescope which was released in 2019 (see Illustration 2)33.

1.6 Gas and dust
Clouds and areas of various gases (although mainly hydrogen) and dust exist throughout the universe. This will be discussed in later sections such as 2.2.3 Interstellar medium (ISM) and 2.4.3 Intergalactic medium (IGM).
 Structures of the universe
2.1 Planetary and star systems
Star systems are gravitationally bound systems with a small number of stars. When two stars are present it is called a binary system. Triple star systems usually form a binary system with the third star orbiting around them. This hierarchical division of multiple-star systems helps describe their orbits as it divides the systems into multiple hierarchical two body systems because the three-body problem has no general solution to date48.

Planetary systems are, as star systems, systems of non-stellar bodies like planets, debris disk and comets, in or out of orbit around a star system or a single star. They can be classified into four categories. Similar, which means all of the planets in the system show similarities in terms of mass (these are the most commonly observed type of planetary systems in the milky way). Mixed, meaning they have large variations of planets masses. Anti-Ordered, meaning the most massive planets are closest to their host star, while less massive planets are further away. Ordered, meaning the mass of the planets increases with distance to their star (our solar system is roughly an example of such a system)49.

2.2 Sub-galactic structures
2.2.1 Star Clusters
Star clusters are gravitationally bound, rather larger groups of stars which can be classified into two main types.
Globular clusters
Globular clusters are areas of more-than-usual for our galaxy densities of stars, which contain from tens of thousands to millions of individual stars. Stars in these clusters tend to be older ones than in open clusters50.
Open clusters
This type of star clusters are populated by much fewer stars than globular clusters, ranging from tens to a few hundred stars and have been observed to contain wider ranges of the age of their stars51.
2.2.3 Interstellar medium (ISM)
Interstellar medium (ISM) consists 75% of hydrogen gas and 25% of helium gas. This gas has a very low density of around one atom per cubic centimeter. Typically it is found in either of two forms: hot ionized gas around young stars or in cold neutral clouds in atomic or molecular form39. These colder regions are also where stars form, when parts of the cloud collapses due to its own gravitational pull.
A small amount of dust, made up of other non-gaseous elements such as silicates, ice, iron and carbon is spread throughout the galaxy as well39.
Areas of higher concentration of interstellar medium are what we see as nebulae in the sky.

2.3 Galaxies
Galaxies contain stars and their remnants, planets, molecular and atomic clouds of gas, dark matter and dust which are bound together by gravity. Their span can range from a few hundred light-years to millions of light-.years. And contain from thousands up to hundreds of trillions of stars. A common feature of larger galaxies is a supermassive black hole at the center of it. They are commonly categorized into three main types according to their visual morphology: elliptical, spiral, or irregular52.

Gravitation organizes galaxies into groups, galaxy clusters and superclusters. Groups contain about or less than 50 galaxies. Galaxy clusters contain between hundreds to thousands of galaxies while superclusters contain clusters and/or groups and form some of the largest structures known53 54.
2.3.1 Intergalactic medium (IGM)
The Intergalactic medium is the matter existing between galaxies and galaxy clusters. It mostly contains ionized hydrogen and helium but the density is one of the lowest in the universe with only one atom per cubic centimeter 39.

2.4 The universeâ€™s large-scale structure
2.4.1 Galaxy filaments
Galaxy filaments are massive structures made up of walls of superclusters and voids. The superclusters tend to build up thread-like structures and the space inbetween, where only few galaxies exist, are the voids53.
2.4.2 The cosmic web
These filaments form what is called the cosmic web also known as the universeâ€™s large scale structure, which is a web or foam like structure in which the universeâ€™s contentâ€™s are organized in.53.
 Mapping of the universe
3.1 Historical overview of cosmic mapping
The mapping of the universe has evolved by a huge margin over millennia, from simple stargazing to advanced technologies that allow us to observe deep into space and time.
3.1.1 Early Astronomy
A over 32.000 year old engraving in a mammoth's tusk is believed to be one of the earliest depictions of an object in the sky known yet19. Ancient astronomy was very limited in accuracy due observationâ€™s being only possible by the naked eye and many helping technologies not existing yet, although singular pieces stand out like Ptolemyâ€™s Almagest which catalogs over a thousand stars20.
3.1.2 Advancements in the Telescope Era
The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century, particularly by Galileo Galilei, marked one of the most important moments in cosmic mapping. Through the newly developed device, the sky, and subsequently the universe, could be studied and mapped to an, compared to before, astonishing degree of accuracy and many previously unknown objects were discovered.
3.1.3 Radio Astronomy and Beyond
Karl Janskyâ€™s discovery of radio waves from the center of the Milky Way, the first discovery of non-visible EMR from an extraterrestrial source, in 1932 laid the foundation for radio astronomy and introduced a new dimension of cosmic mapping21. This enabled scientists to discover even m
